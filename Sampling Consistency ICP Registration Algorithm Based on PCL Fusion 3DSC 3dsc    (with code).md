#  I. Overview of algorithms 

   The registration method that fuses the coarse registration of the 3DSC feature descriptor descriptor and the fine registration of the ICP algorithm is not much seen in the paper at present (only this one: [1] Xu Guangxuan, Pang Yajun, Bai Zhenxu, Wang Yulei, Lu Zhiwei. A Fast Point Clouds Registration Algorithm for Laser Scanners [J]. Applied Sciences, 2021, 11 (8)). However, there are quite a lot of codes on the Internet about 3DSC + ICP. After taking a look, it is basically impossible to run the correct results. This article gives the complete runnable code.
