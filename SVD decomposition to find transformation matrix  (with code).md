#  IV. Test data 

 The test data is generated by MATLAB code, which is as follows: 

  ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574250969
  ```  
 You can verify the above C++ code by yourself, it should be noted that: 

 The rotation matrix from data1 to data2 in the test data is: 

  ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574250969
  ```  
 The translation vector is: 

  ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574250969
  ```  
 It is equivalent to the expression of C++ transformation matrix. 

  ```python
