#  First, the principle of the algorithm 

   Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each field of the given point cloud data x, y, z coordinates, where the standard deviation is implemented as n-1. 

#  Second, the main function 

##  1. Call function 1 

  ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574233129
  ```  
   Given a vector of type float, calculate the mean and standard deviation of the given point cloud data simultaneously, where the standard deviation is n-1 

##  2. Call function 2 

  ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574233129
  ```  
   There is no essential difference between the two, both are given a vector of float type, and calculate the mean and standard deviation of the given point cloud data at the same time, where the standard deviation is n-1

  ```  
   The calculation method is the same, so the result is the same!!! 

#  IV. Handwriting implementation 

   This simple calculation, although there are calling functions, may not be easy to use. So write your own code that is convenient to call. The standard deviation is n to achieve.
